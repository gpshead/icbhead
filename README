This code was originally derived from the old Python icb client code from
 http://a.armory.com/~zenomt/icb.py

I have no idea what the license on that is.  So until I find out,
there is no real license on this.  Use it at your own risk.

I'll sort that out later, I'd like to Apache 2 license the entire thing.

Status:
* skimpy bones, differences from the old icb.py so far are:
  - Requires Python 3.1 or later to run.
    (how's that for keeping the rabble away?)
  - No longer word wraps long lines coming from other people as open
    messages as that breaks URLs.
  - It word wraps your own longer than 239 char lines into multiple
    messages.  Input is capped at 2x that limit anyways (no spammies).
  - It shortens long URLs in your own lines using goo.gl.
  - It prefixes openmsg and privmsg lines with a timestamp.
  - It periodically sends a ping over the connection to avoid NAT
    timeouts from dropping it while everyone is at a cocktail party.

TODO list:
* Refactoring and code improvements:
  - Refactor the long if/elif blocks to method dispatch.
  - Add unittests for much of the old code.
* URL shortening:
  - Optionally goo.gl incoming URLs (is that wise?).
  - On goo.gl shortened URLs include a (note.com) mention after them with
    the original domain name if it is not rediculiously long.
* Implementation and usability improvements:
  - Intelligently word wrap incoming text by detecting URLs and never
    breaking them for optimal cut and paste action.
  - Investigate using readline. That the ancient code implements its own
    basic input & line editing is sad.
  - Move the network IO and update of the chat log into its own thread
    and scrolling region so that a partially typed message doesn't cause
    a backlog of scroll.
